# Not Reddit #

## Introduction: ##

Not Reddit was created to practice and to challenge myself. The goal is to recreate Reddit's main features.

The idea of this app came by following **codecademy** full stacked developer course. All the code that you will see in this project was created by me, all implementation ideas are mine.

### Basic App Features: ###

- Implement a landing page with featured posts from different subreddits.
    - Implement pages for each post, these should display comments and subreddit information.
    - Make a sidebar that displays subreddit information, links, and useful information.
- Make it so the user can change subreddits and view the best/hot posts from each subreddit.
- Implement a searchBar.
- Make a "fake" upvote/downvote feature (It shouldn't POST to Reddit).
- Create a template for user profiles, and make it so that the user can see a user's information.
- Make a [skeleton loading](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-skeleton-screens-using-css-for-better-user-experience/#:~:text=A%20skeleton%20screen%20is%20an,%2C%20card%2C%20and%20so%20on.) feature / Responsiveness.

### More Advanced Features: ###

*These features might not be implemented.*

- LogIn/LogOut feature.
- Real upvotes/downvotes (Posts to Reddit with the user information).
- Comment / Delete Comment.
- User Actions (Friend, subscribe, follow, etc)
